# Benchmarks

Navigate to this directory and create a `conda` virtual environment, as so:

```sh
$ conda create -n river-benchmarks -y python==3.8.5
$ conda activate river-benchmarks
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that this will install the development version of `river` from GitHub. You can change this behaviour by modifying `requirements.txt` before creating the virtual environment.
