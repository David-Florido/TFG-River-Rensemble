# 0.4.4 - 2019-11-11

- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/river/0.4.4/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/online-ml/river/releases/tag/0.4.4)

This release was mainly made to provide access to `wheels <https://pythonwheels.com/>`_ for Windows and MacOS.

## ensemble

- Added `ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier`.

## linear_model

- Added a `clip_gradient` parameter to `linear_model.LinearRegression` and `linear_model.LogisticRegression`. Gradient clipping was already implemented, but the maximum absolute value can now be set by the user.
- The `intercept_lr` parameter of `linear_model.LinearRegression` and `linear_model.LogisticRegression` can now be passed an instance of `optim.schedulers.Scheduler` as well as a `float`.

## metrics

- Fixed `metrics.SMAPE`, the implementation was missing a multiplication by 2.

## optim

- Added `optim.schedulers.Optimal` produces results that are identical to `sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor` and `sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier` when setting their `learning_rate` parameter to `'optimal'`.

## time_series

- Added `time_series.SNARIMAX`, a generic model which encompasses well-known time series models such as ARIMA and NARX.
