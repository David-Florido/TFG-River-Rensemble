# 0.5.1 - 2020-03-29

- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/river/0.5.1/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/online-ml/river/releases/tag/0.5.1)

## compose

- `compose.Pipeline` and `compose.TransformerUnion` now variadic arguments as input instead of a list. This doesn't change anything when using the shorthand operators `|` and `+`.

## model_selection

- Removed `model_selection.successive_halving`
- Added `model_selection.SuccessiveHalvingRegressor` and `model_selection.SuccessiveHalvingClassifier`

## stream

- Added a `copy` parameter to `stream.simulate_qa` in order to handle unwanted feature modifications.

## tree

- Added a `curtail_under` parameter to `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`.
- The speed and accuracy of both `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` and `tree.RandomForestClassifier` has been slightly improved for numerical attributes.
- The esthetics of the `tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.draw` method have been improved.
