class VariationInfo(base.MultiClassMetric):
    r"""Variation of Information.

    Variation of Information (VI) [^1] [^2] is an information-based clustering measure.
    It is presented as a distance measure for comparing partitions (or clusterings)
    of the same data. It therefore does not distinguish between hypothesised and
    target clustering. VI has a number of useful properties, as follows

    * VI satisifes the metric axioms

    * VI is convexly additive. This means that, if a cluster is split, the distance
    from the new cluster to the original is the distance induced by the split times
    the size of the cluster. This guarantees that all changes to the metrics are "local".

    * VI is not affected by the number of data points in the cluster. However, it is bounded
    by the logarithm of the maximum number of clusters in true and predicted labels.

    The Variation of Information is calculated using the following formula

    $$
    VI(C, K) = H(C) + H(K) - 2 H(C, K) = H(C|K) + H(K|C)
    $$

    The bound of the variation of information [^3] can be written in terms of the number of elements,
    $VI(C, K) \leq \log(n)$, or with respect to the maximum number of clusters $K^*$,
    $VI(C, K) \leq 2 \log(K^*)$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cm
        This parameter allows sharing the same confusion
        matrix between multiple metrics. Sharing a confusion matrix reduces the amount of storage
        and computation time.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from river import metrics

    >>> y_true = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
    >>> y_pred = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

    >>> metric = metrics.VariationInfo()

    >>> for yt, yp in zip(y_true, y_pred):
    ...     print(metric.update(yt, yp).get())
    0.0
    0.0
