"""Feature preprocessing.

The purpose of this module is to modify an existing set of features so that they can be processed
by a machine learning algorithm. This may be done by scaling numeric parts of the data or by
one-hot encoding categorical features. The difference with the `feature_extraction` module is that
the latter extracts new information from the data
